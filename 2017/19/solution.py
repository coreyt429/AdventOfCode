"""
Advent Of Code 2017 day 19

This one was tougher than it should have been.  I had the beginnings of a grid system
in my aoc module, which would handle different coordinate systems, data stores, and
position identifiers.  It worked well for another puzzle, and was not fully tested.

So I spent more time rewriting that and testing it thoroughly  before working on
this puzzle.

I'm happy with the new Grid() class.  It worked well.  

I'm a bit slow on this puzzle, I think it could be dramatically sped up by just noting
the position of all of the + and letters as well as the directions you can travel from
them.  Then we would just need to find the next one on the same line, and get the
manhattan distance between the points to count steps.  Maybe I can work on that later.
