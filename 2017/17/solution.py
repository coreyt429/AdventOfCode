Advent Of Code 2017 day 17

Okay, this one I tripped myself.  My first thought was to use deque and spin instead
of middle insert.  Buuut, I convinced myself that I would have to spin it back, and
that would possibly be less efficient than a list.  So I tried list, and it was horribly
slow. Looked at a few other implementations, and kicked myself for not sticking with
deque. So here is my fianlish deque solution.  I still feel like there is a faster
math solution here, and I just don't have the energy for that today, so maybe later
