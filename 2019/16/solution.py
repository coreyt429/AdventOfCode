Advent Of Code 2019 day 16

On this one, I completely failed to see the obvious pattern in part 2.

Credit to u/kwenti for the level2() solution below, and chatGPT for
explaining it until I understood.  I tried to use the idea of the pattern
with my solution, and just couldn't get the speed without processing the
same way.  So my final solution looks very similar to the level2()
function.

    Modified from original by u/kwenti

    Used to get explanation from chatGPT, which pointed out what I was missing
    Since the target range is in the second half, our pattern [0, 1, 0, -1] means
    up through offset, the values are multiplied 0, after that they are multiplied by 1
    I'm trying to use this knowledge to optimize my solution first, but also
    getting a better understanding of itertools.cycle and itertools.accumulate used below,
    so I may end up using that as well, if I can't get a decent time otherwise.

    Due to lack of time, running as is.
