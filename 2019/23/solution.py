"""
Advent Of Code 2019 day 23

IntCodeComputer handled this pretty well.  Part 1, I worked completely in
the scratchpad.

Part 2, converted the part 1 logic into get_next_nat() then the solve() logic
is simply get_next_nat() was y_val is the same as the last return y_val, if not stick it in
iccs[0].inputs

The couple of trip ups I had, in case they help anyone else are:
  - don't move packets from outputs to packet_queue until they are complete
  - don't compare y_val to last_y_val in every pass, only the when inputs_waiting
    is false.

Part 2 was taking 4.4 seconds.  Tried changing the lists to deque to use popleft()
instead of pop(0).  This does not seem to have impacted run time.

profiling shows intcode.py:302(step) as the culprit, but further optimzations there
are not really justified to shave 4.4 seconds down.  As this would require regression
testing against previous puzzles using the code as well.
