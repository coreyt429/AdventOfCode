"""
Advent Of Code 2019 day 15

I frustrated myself with this one.  By now I should know shortest path means
BFS or dijkstra.  No, I was stuck on the IntCodeComputer state being untouchable
and tried a DFS like attempt that almost worked.  It ended up taking an off map
short cut that I couldn't explain.  Regardless, the BFS approach I ended up with
made filling out the map for part 2 painless.

Part 1 was taking 1.6 seconds, and part 2 1.9 (1.6 of which was rerunning part 1).
So I opted to do everything on the first pass, and store the part 2 answer. So
now they run in 1.9 seconds and 0.9 seconds.

The failed first attempt did shake out an inefficiency in my Grid() class, or rather
in the Node() class for shortest paths.  Node().has_loops was inefficient, and taking
up most of the processing time.  Improved it significantly,  then scrapped the code
that was using it so hopefully that will save the day some other day.
