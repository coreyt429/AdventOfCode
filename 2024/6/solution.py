Advent Of Code 2024 day 6

Part 1, was a a fun implementation of Grid()

Part 2, I implemented Floyd's cycle detection algorithm.  It gets the right answer, and
takes too long. Cleaning up the code and saving for now, will revisit to speed up.

Thoughts for speeding up.
    1) store visited points from part 1, in part two, add the neighbors of these points,
       and remove the start position.  This will be the subset of points we should try.
       That should at least reduce the time to 1/3.  I fear that may still be too long
    2) map the # points, and calculate decision points based on them. should be significantly
       faster, but will require some thought.
       Wait, this is it:

       def scan_to_block(self):
         # scan ahead in direction until we see a block
         self.teleport(point_before_block)
         return self.pos
    
       def has_loop(self):
         already = set()
         self.reset()
         current_point = self.pos
         next_point = self.scan_to_block()
         while (current_point, next_point) not in already:
            is_loop = True
            self.turn()
            current_point = next_point
            next_point = self.scan_to_block()
            if next_point is None:
                return False
        return True
        
Part 2 is running now in 11 seconds. In addition to the above, I precalculated the block locations
to minimize iteration on the Grid()
