Advent Of Code 2024 day 4

Grid() made this one fairly easy. I extended it to at an items() method that I ended
up not using.  I think that will come in handy in the future though, as I usually
end up doing something like this:
for point in grid:
    char = grid.get_point(point)
    # do something with char

Now I can just do this:
for point, char in grid.items():
    # do something with char

The only trip ups on this one were typo's ([all_directions]  !- all_directions),
and bad assumptions
