"""
Advent Of Code 2024 day 18

Part 1 was a simple pathfinding problem. I used the Grid class to solve it.
I created a grid of 71x71 and marked the corrupted points with a wall.
Then I used the shortest_paths method from the grid class to find the shortest
path from the start to the end.
The answer was the length of the shortest path minus 1.

Part 2 was going to take a while to solve, so I decided to use a binary search.
I started with the whole list of corrupted points and checked if the path was
blocked. If it was, I moved the unsafe point closer to the safe point.
If the path was not blocked, I moved the safe point to the unsafe point.
I kept doing this until the difference between the safe and unsafe points was 1.
Then I returned the point that was the unsafe point.
