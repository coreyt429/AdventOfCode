"""
Advent Of Code 2018 day 23

Part1 was quick and easy.

Part2 Brute force was impractical. Though I did use the opportunity to improve
my manhattan_distance function.

I reveiewed a couple of z3 implementations for this, and thougth that sounded familiar.
Dusted off an older z3 solution I used in the past (technically future since it was a 2023
puzzle).  I had issues running any of these on my current system, and instead focused
on a simple math solution from u/EriiKKo.

This solution I feel may be making assumptions that aren't true for the general case,
but work with the input data and test data. So it works in the context of this puzzle.

My understanding of the logic is to collapse the 3d structure to a line, and identify the
point in that line that is inside the most circles.
