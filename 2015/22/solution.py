Advent Of Code 2015 day 22

I struggled with this one the first time through.  I thought I had it, and was just cleaning up code
this time.  Wrong!.  my previous solution (script.py if you dig back into the git repo) runs really
fast, and gets the wrong answer.  So I wrote this more elegant OO monstrocity to solve the problem.
So now I get the right answer, just slowly:
(base) PS AdventOfCode> run
Part 1: 953, took 7.938987493515015 seconds
Part 2: 1289, took 44.9357545375824 seconds

I may revisit my old solution and compare, it must just be missing some condition, but with this
solution, I was able to add tracing to the GameState class (sorry, removed it to speed up once
working) to identify logic issues.  In case this helps in future reviews, the last bug fixed,
was not handling loss in the hard mode hp-1 stage.
