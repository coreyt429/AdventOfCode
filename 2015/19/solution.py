Fudge!!!!!!

Okay, so I failed at this one in my original attempt, but I know more now, I can do this. Right?

So, my original implementation was a bfs (likely borrowed, from who I don't recall). But it 
didn't work.

So I tried improving it, and decided the search space was just too big, so....

Lets try Dijkstra.  Pruning will help right.  no.

A* sounds good, what's a good heuristic,  memory error.

Read through other solutions, and found CYK.  Discussed CYK with chatGPT for hours.
Worked through examples manually, and programatically, great.  lets try it with the
example data HOHOHO.  yeah, no go my implementation didn't work with this grammar.

utter frustration.

lets try this over complex parsing and grouping routine and DFS it.  nope, ran into impossible
combinations.

ugh.  lets just play with the data in the scratchpad.  what happens if I just replace all the
substrings.  hey, that was shorter.  what if I do it again.  shorter.  3 times, shorter.

4 times.  e  wtf?  that simple?  really.
