Advent Of Code 2020 day 22

I had this one except for one little line I missed in the instructions:
(the quantity of cards copied is equal to the number on the card they drew to trigger the sub-game)

Without this, the test data worked, and the puzzle data looped forever.

Add this in, and the puzzle data finishes in about 3 seconds.
