"""
Advent Of Code 2020 day 15

I played around with data structures on this one. 

I started with a big deque for the numbers.  worked great for
test data and part 1.  way to big and slow for part 2.

Converted that to a defaultdict(deque) keyed on the number and
queing its appearances.  Worked, solved the problem, slow.

Optimized deque to only store the last two values.  This got it
down to 22 seconds.

Dropped both, and went with a dict(tuple) keyed on number with
value as a tuple of the last two instances.  time is doen to 13
seconds for part 2, so leaving it at that.
