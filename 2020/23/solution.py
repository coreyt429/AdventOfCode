Advent Of Code 2020 day 23

Part 1 was fairly easy.  Part 2 I had two cycle through a few different approaches.

Initially I was working with deque to make rotating the circle easy.  Worked well for Part 1,
was too slow for even short runs on the part 2 cups.

Next I converted that code to use numpy.array().  This was 10 times faster, and still would
have taken a really long time.

The Next iteration was linked lists using list().  This was significantly faster, and would
have worked in walk away and come back later time (20-30 minutes maybe).

So I converted the lists to numpy.array(), which again significantly sped up the operation.
I don't like 5-10 minute solutions, though. So I profiled it to see where the bottlenecks were.
replaced the pickedup set with a numpy.array() of booleans.  This was got it closer, but
initializing it on each pass was still taking time.  So I moved it to the outside of the loop
and added = False statements at the end of the loop to reset the flags after they were used.

I'm at a consistent < 40 seconds now, and I'm happy with that for this one.
