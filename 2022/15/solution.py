Advent Of Code 2022 day 15

I thought I had this one, I thought, I could math the heck out of it.

I did.  wrongly!  I spent a while trying to treat my scan_range as
the radius of a circle, when the instructions made it clear we were
using manhattan_distance, and the resulting area was diamond shaped.
