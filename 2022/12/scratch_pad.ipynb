The heightmap shows the local area from above broken into a grid; the elevation of each square of the grid is given by a single lowercase letter, where a is the lowest elevation, b is the next-lowest, and so on up to the highest elevation, z.\\n\\nAlso included on the heightmap are marks for your current position (S) and the location that should get the best signal (E). Your current position (S) has elevation a, and the location that should get the best signal (E) has elevation z.\\n\\nYou'd like to reach E, but to save energy, you should do it in as few steps as possible. During each step, you can move exactly one square up, down, left, or right. To avoid needing to get out your climbing gear, the elevation of the destination square can be at most one higher than the elevation of your current square; that is, if your current elevation is m, you could step to elevation n, but not to elevation o. (This also means that the elevation of the destination square can be much lower than the elevation of your current square.)\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nSabqponm\\nabcryxxl\\naccszExk\\nacctuvwj\\nabdefghi\\n\\nHere, you start in the top-left corner; your goal is near the middle.

The beginning isn't very scenic, though; perhaps you can find a better starting point.\\n\\nTo maximize exercise while hiking, the trail should start as low as possible: elevation a. The goal is still the square marked E. However, the trail should still be direct, taking the fewest steps to reach its goal. So, you'll need to find the shortest path from any square at elevation a to the square marked E.\\n\\nAgain consider the example from above:\\n\\nSabqponm\\nabcryxxl\\naccszExk\\nacctuvwj\\nabdefghi\\n\\nNow, there are six choices for starting position (five marked a, plus the square marked S that counts as being at elevation a).
