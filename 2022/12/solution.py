"""
Advent Of Code 2022 day 12

Struggled on this one with a simple miss.  We can only go up one level, but we
can apparently go down more. Which was stated in the rules, I just misunderstood.

I was thinking my input was bad, because I got the right anser by changing 1 character.
Until I ran my input through the solution from u/themanushiya, and found that it worked.
reviewing I saw that solution was just checking for the next step to be less than current + 1.

I made that change in my code, and it worked.

part 2 takes longer than I would like, but I'll likely leave it for now.
Maybe not, I forgot I did the work to make Grid hashable, so lru_cache worked for get_next()
