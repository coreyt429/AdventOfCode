"""
Advent Of Code 2022 day 11

Part 1 was pretty smooth.

I struggled with part 2, but possibly due to being in a meeting the whole time.

Thanks to u/jaccomoc, your solution pointed out what I was doing wrong in mine.
I was finding the least common multiple of the divisor tests, and was implementing
it wrong in my solution. Doing it the right way made it run a lot faster.

Also probably wasted 30 minutes or so trying to figure out why the test data wasn't
getting the right answer, and it was because 1000 != 10000.  Needed to run the
correct number of loops.

After that, part 2 would have run smoothly, except that I forgot to change the
divisor from 3 to 1. So it quickly got the wrong answer.
