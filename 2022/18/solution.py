"""
Advent Of Code 2022 day 18

Part 1 was pretty easy.  Part 2, I got the answer no problem, but couldn't
get my shortest path solution to run any faster than 180 seconds.

Looking around, it looks like everyone else realized it was faster
to fill the outside space and cound the cube faces it comes into contact with.

That worked and only took 2.9 seconds.

I'm leaving the framework of my shortest path solution as well, for educational
purposes. (mine mainly)
