# AdventOfCode

My Advent of Code solutions.

After past failed attempts, I took 2023 seriously as a project to transition from Perl to Python.

After completing 2023, I started back at 2015 and am  slowly making my way through.

Starting with the 2016 puzzles, I'm trying to get a clean pylint run from each solution to enforce coding practices. At some point I will review 2023 and 2015 to clean them up, as well as revisit those solutions to improve with new knowledge. Those were heavily borrowed from chatGPT and reddit solutions, and I can do better now.

Notes on chatGPT and these solutions:
  - gpt3.5 and gpt4 are not good at figuring out these puzzles
  - common gpt questions:
    - How do I do this <paste Perl code> in python
	- How do I do X in python
	- Explain this <paste python code from solution I don't understand>
