Advent Of Code 2021 day 10

I tripped a couple times on this one.  My first attempt to identify corrupted lines
didn't work because it also matched incomplete lines.  My second attempt didn't
take into account the last open set being the one that needed to close first.  I
modified that for the final is_corrupted version.

Part 2 was fairly easy, the logic I used for part 1 was already identifying the expected
closings.  I could probably return them from is_corrupted, and not have to find them
in auto_complete, but part 2 is already running in 0.001 seconds, so no real need
to optimize.  I failed my first answer, because I didn't copy scores.sort() from
my test code to solve() function.
