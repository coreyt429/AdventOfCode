Advent Of Code 2021 day 6

I started this one out actually spawning the fish, and trying to
find patterns.

In part two, I realized this was just too slow, and we only needed
the fish count in the end.  So I switched to just counting the
number of fish in each state each day.

    This will work for part 1, and can be used two ways:
    1) slow way, pass the whole start fish list to it
    2) faster way, run one unique fish number at a time, then
       add up the totals
